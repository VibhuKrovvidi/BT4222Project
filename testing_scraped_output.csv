65,"Hi Juneeta, thank you for the review! We're happy to know that you liked our service and our food barring the Dal Makhani.

Unfortunately, I think we didn't do a good enough job explaining the dish to you before you ordered. Dal Makhani is essentially our most indulgent dish. We cook dal for hours in ghee, onions, tomatoes, and cream. So, it's definitely very heavy, but only it contains a lot of love :) And, yes, we use ghee and not oil.

The next time you come around, now that we know your preference, we'll be sure to offer less indulgent and lighter dishes :)

For the papadum, it's the lijjat papad served as an accompaniment with our biryani, actually meant for 1 person! If you're looking to get more papadum to share, our friendly staff will be more than happy to provide.

We look forward to serving you at Gravy again soon.",Gravy_Restaurant

76,"Hi Praveen, thank you so much for the feedback. We're glad you liked the food barring the Subz desh videsh. We're sorry that it wasn't to your liking, your preference has already been noted, and the next time you visit us, we'll try to recommend other dishes that more suit your taste :) On the colour, we don't use artificial colouring, in this instance, it's haldi (turmeric) which was a bit too much. This has already been informed to the chef team, and this has been rectified immediately.

On the pricing, we honestly feel our pricing is really fair considering the portion sizes and quality that we do offer. Hope that you may agree when you visit us more often!!!

Thank you again, and look forward to serving you again soon.",Gravy_Restaurant

After much investigation, we manage to understand better what went wrong during your dining experience. Prior to your visit with us, we have already informed you about the time slot allocated for each reservation as there was already a table booked after you. Fridays are one of our busiest day so we try our best to accommodate for everyone. On that ground, we accepted your reservation and provided you with a seating from 7-830pm. The bill was presented to you upon request and signed off at 840pm. We apologize if we were not able to have you seated longer but it was only fair that each diner be granted their allocated length of stay, especially when reservations protocols have to be adhered to strictly, especially due to the pandemic situation. The owner was indeed mingling with some of her clients but it will be impossible for one to expect her to be talking to each and every table, especially when one has limited time on hand to handle orders, dish out the meals as well as handle the cashiering. You went on to bring forth the question, asking our manager if our owner was ""being racist?"", which we think was not necessary and uncalled for. We have never judged anyone on race, and welcome everyone to our place for the past 24 years but we apologize if you have mistakenly thought that you were being judged.

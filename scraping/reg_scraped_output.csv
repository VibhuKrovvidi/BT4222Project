"Hi Juneeta, thank you for the review! We're happy to know that you liked our service and our food barring the Dal Makhani.

Unfortunately, I think we didn't do a good enough job explaining the dish to you before you ordered. Dal Makhani is essentially our most indulgent dish. We cook dal for hours in ghee, onions, tomatoes, and cream. So, it's definitely very heavy, but only it contains a lot of love :) And, yes, we use ghee and not oil.

The next time you come around, now that we know your preference, we'll be sure to offer less indulgent and lighter dishes :)

For the papadum, it's the lijjat papad served as an accompaniment with our biryani, actually meant for 1 person! If you're looking to get more papadum to share, our friendly staff will be more than happy to provide.

We look forward to serving you at Gravy again soon.",8 months ago, 5 stars ,Gravy_Restaurant

The wagyu bowl was incredibly good. Drool worthy. The only reason I'm giving a four and not a five is that I ordered +50% beef (which costs a whopping $10+) but the extra beef was clearly less than 50%. I felt a little ripped off.

"Dear Lucy,

Warmest Greetings from Sapore Italian Restaurant!

We appreciate you taking the time to write for us a long and detailed review!

It was a pleasure hosting you and your family on a nice lovely Saturday afternoon.
The food that you tasted: Homemade Pumpkin Soup, Sea Bass alla Mediterranean, Tagliatelle del Sapore, Capricciosa Pizza were prepared the authentic and healthy way, since 2011.
All of them as you mentioned were without any taste enhancers, naturally flavoured using in-house vegetable stock.
Our quality food, customer-centric service, cozy, comfortable ambience and affordable prices are important elements that captivate the hearts of our regular customers.
Thank you as well for your kind words, we will pass on the feedback to Jim.

We look forward to hosting you and your family at Sapore in the near future.
Thank you for your support and choosing to dine at Sapore once again!
Wishing you a great day ahead!

With Best Regards,
Sapore Team",6 months ago, 4 stars ,Sapore

Thank you for your helpful review.
In this difficult time we try our best to follow rules and protect our customers, our staff and our business.
As you said we did not allowed your entrance because Trace Together app showed  in red ""Test Status Not Cleared"", maybe we are not too flexible, but I assure you we are not having fun to refuse the entry to anyone.

In our restaurant as per FB regulation we accept the following People:
-Who has been Vaccinated (Trace Together app or ICA Stam on Passport for foreigners)
-Who has PET (Pre Event Test) with validity of 24hrs, Document must showed in Hard copy or Via Trace together/Health Hub Profile, Screen shoot not allowed.
-Recovered from COVID-19 who has PET (Pre Event Test) Exemption Notice, Document must showed in Hard copy or Via Trace together/Health Hub Profile, Screen shoot not allowed.
-Maximum Capacity per Table 2 pax

Regarding our protection standards, staff must wear mask properly which means cover mouth and nose while in the restaurant, if was not like that be assured we will take some action.
I hope you can accept our sincere apologise, is not our intention to discriminate anyone, we are just trying to play our good part in this difficult and confused time.
Best Regard and Stay Safe.

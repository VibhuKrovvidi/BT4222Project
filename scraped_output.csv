51,Happy cause I found a place that can rival three buns (& at more reasonable prices!) We had no.1 and no.2 and the highlight is definitely their patty - had it medium and it was so juicy. Flavours are strong yet well balanced. Onion rings tad foo oily so will skip that next time.,TFDB

My favorite would be the number 2 as the tomato gives it extra omph juicy factor ‚Ä¶",TFDB

Which picture in particular are you referring to? please email me adam@potatohead.co
I assure you there was no trickery in the shots, just the ingredients we use in the burgers. we are a bit more expensive compared to other burger shops, because we only ever use best quality ingredients, our meats are quality grass fed from Argentina and New Zealand, only using prime cuts, all the sauces and condiments are made from scratch in house. We are not a fast food burger joint, so if you want to compare us to something like Mcdonalds, its not even in the same class, Mcdonalds makes cheap food, we make quality fresh burgers with natural ingredients, a fast food burger will be cheaper to produce than our beef patty alone.
I am happy to discuss this further,

33,"Dear Tony,

Thank you for the feedback, was it the last order that was salty? have the previous orders been ok?
I have reiterated to the chefs to taste everything again, everything is made in. house or to our specs.
we are more pricey than some other burger shops but that is because we only use quality ingredients and everything made from scratch, our beef is only 100% prime grass fed beef, which hormone and antibiotic free, our lamb is natural fed from New Zealand and our Chicken is local fresh.
I really appreciate that you have been supporting us for the 3rd time,
please feel free to email me adam@potatohead.co

Best wishes,

Adam Penney",TR

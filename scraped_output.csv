5,"Diner time and date: 8 October 2021, 1pm. My wife and I popped by on the way through errands and oh boy it was wonderful. Wife had no.1 and I had the no.2. It was a nice touch that they had 2 servicing sizes; smaller size for the discerning …"

7,Great burgers that reminds you of LA. The only thing missing is the perfect weather. Fantastic char to the patty and the onion rings were nicely done
8,"Came to try on a discount. Interesting flavors available. Patty was seared well with a salty (in a good way) crispy crust. Overall, would come again on a discount, but maybe not on full price."
9,"This place quite possibly has the best burgers in Singapore! We tried the number 1 and number 2 and both were superb. Meat is juicy and well seasoned. The cheese is tasty as is the sauce. The veggies are placed neatly OUTSIDE the burger, …"

15,Burgers are really great. Enjoyed the juicy patty and the fluffy brioches buns. They have cheap wine bottles as well
16,"The 25 degrees breakfast is good with nicely scrambled eggs. The sausage is mushy (not sure if it’s supposed to be that way) and weird. Hash brown is crispy and potato-ey. The waffles is meh, not hard enough on the outside and too soft."

19,"The burgers here are sublime (I had the ""Number Three""). The beef patty melts in your mouth, and the brioche bun is slightly crispy on the part touching the patty, which adds a delectable texture to the burger as a whole."
20,Exceed my expectation.  Number 1 burger
21,First impression is the queue - the queue is quite long during even a weekday for dinner. Around 30 mins waiting for us around 730 pm. They don’t accept reservation. …

23,"The burger was excellently cooked. I ordered medium, and it was still pretty juicy. Fresh lettuce on the side you can add yourself, and the crunchiness was a delight to every bite. There's a craft-your-own burger on the menu which allows …"
24,Lovely burger!
25,The sides like fried broccoli is unusual and onion rings are nicer than fast food chain as they aare made from sliced onions. The burgers were major letdown- buttered chicken wasn’t chicken thigh as stated in menu which I’m ok but the end …
26,"Yummy and juicy burger made to perfection. Absolutely worth the price. Thee beef patty and smooth and not greasy, no tough tendons too. Kids love it. Friendly customer service"
27,Friendly staff and delicious burger.
28,Great place for food.. Burger w friends and family
29,Amazing burgers. Strongly recommend the number one burger! Bought the signature burger and milkshake deal with Kris+ and it makes this even more worth it. Will definitely visit this place again to try the other burger options

37,"Nice juicy burger! Bread is soft and patty is juicy and tasty..

Garlic Chicken wings is very delicious. With fries at the bottom.  Very nice snack
Recommended"
38,Very reasonably priced burgers. Filling and tasty. Meat was cooked to the right temperature and was fairly juicy but it just didn't taste like it was seasoned right. Wouldn't mind coming back to try other burgers again though just for comparison.
39,Juicy burger patties topped off with cheese and served between 2 fluffy brioche buns
40,"Beautiful burger bar, amazingly helpful staff
The decor and ambience is so welcoming. …"
41,Good Fries
42,"The most complete burger I have eaten so far.
The Number One is not a purist's burger as it is chock full of ingredients. But the combination is so well done, it puts the burger at a whole other level. Add some curly fries and you get a perfect meal."
43,Very greasy breakfast…with a bitter coffee

45,The burgers are not bad. However disappointed with the salad due to take away. You don't enjoy what a salad is supposed to be when the dressing are separated for takeaway.

47,
48,Very unfriendly.  Service slow. Food was ordinary.  McDonald's standard but pricier. Coleslaw was off totally.  Mayo used was probably too old and curdled. Tasted weird. Definitely need to look into it! $6 a portion for this Coleslaw is also a rip-off!
49,Don't order delivery or takeaway from this place. They don't know how to manage their order systems properly to get you your order on time.
50,"The food is very good, but the management is too sneaky for their own good.

The menu lists a Family Box that comprises 4 burgers and 2 sides. So you would …"
51,Happy cause I found a place that can rival three buns (& at more reasonable prices!) We had no.1 and no.2 and the highlight is definitely their patty - had it medium and it was so juicy. Flavours are strong yet well balanced. Onion rings tad foo oily so will skip that next time.
52,"Pricy, but delicious, well made, and they aren't afraid of medium rare beef."
53,burgers were great! loved the number 1! really one of the best burgers i had!
54,"Very nice burgers at value for money pricing - wish I have known this place much earlier! Tried both their No 1 and No 2, both are yummy. Asked for medium doneness for both beef patties and am really pleased that they nailed it beautifully …"

57,"Amazing service from Gina. Well informed about the menu, makes excellent recommendations and just incredibly polite and nice. Possibly the best service I’ve experienced in Singapore. She went out of her way to get us a table for three, walk-in. Just amazing. Burgers are great, and fries are awesome!"
58,Possibly the best burger I've had in town for awhile
59,Its quite good and decent. The place is also rather comfortable too!
60,"Love the burgers here! Its as good as omakase burger! Ordered both number 1 and number 2, i like the meat as it is juicy and their onion rings are really nice.
My favorite would be the number 2 as the tomato gives it extra omph juicy factor …"
61,"Juiciest burger ever! Great flavors too! Me and my friend got No.1 & No.2. She loved the onion rings! Must try! The place is tad hot, wished it could be a little breezy. But its a great place to sit and have a burger, cold beer and people watching on a sundays kinda situation. You're welcome 😁"
62,
63,Juicy burgers and milkshakes are fantastic. Fries could be lesser saltier though.
64,Amazing place with good food and worth the waiting time. If you go here please get the burgers and sides and milkshakes!! The beef burgers' patties are even cooked to your choice of doneness:)The sides are slightly small for price but still tasty. Staff even gave a free desert for birthday girl!

Service is good too 😃😃😃"

Having the 1-for-1 beer. Apparently only the 250ml tapped beer. It need to come along with sides. The sides are limited to fries.

86,Cheap local breakfast option
87,"Number one Burger is good. Probably one of the top in SG. The avocado scrambled eggs is also great! Have to queue up for quite awhile on a saturday night - about 25 mins. They don't do reservations. Waiter is friendly. The female waitress seems to be a in a rush to walk away while taking our order, perhaps due to understaffed?"
88,"Burgers are awesome! Thought they were kidding when were asked for the done-ness of the patty. Really well grilled and cheese is beautifully melted. There are a few sides available as well. Super value for money, especially if u take up the happy hours meals. Loved it!"
89,"Cheap local breakfast. Nice ambience, good place to watch the world walking by"
90,"The buns are really fluffy n crispy! The regular serving is 120g meat patty. Personally the upsize to 200g will suit an adult more. Overall, very good tasty burgers."
91,Good flavour however the burger patty tasted with ‘rough’ and a little dry despite asking for the patty to be done Medium. The quality of the beef grind might not have been good. …

Remember to try the chicken wings too. …"
102,"They have a good variety of burgers that are all juicy-licious. We try a different burger each time we're here and I haven't been disappointed.

113,Great experience here! Look out for their ongoing promotions to make your dining more worthwhile. Food was amazing!
114,"Great burgers, generous portion and very good pricing."
115,"Cafe was highly reviewed so we went to try. Burger was dry, does not have much taste. Didnt justify the price we were paying for. Onion rings was oily and had no seasoning. Would have paid the same price for wolf burger or shake shack."
116,"Burger patty is dry, food is not very good. The queue is not worth it, have had better burgers for the price. Ambience and service is not bad. Not sure if standard drop after food long."
117,Good service and food.
118,"Great burgers, recommended for a casual eat. Service was friendly but a little slow considering it was very quiet in there.
Recommended for a good burger and a beer 🍻"
119,"Open air ambience can be hit or miss, and in our case, a big miss. It was warm and stuffy and poorly lit, and much less enjoyable because we're along the roadside. Food was decent though, but might not be worth it if not for the promos"
120,Very satisfying piece of burger at very reasonable price. Great service as well.
121,"If there was an option to choose 0 stars, this  place would earn it. Restaurant is known for its supposed american LA ambience & food while the ambiance could pass for that old american restaurant feel, the food was on the other spectrum of …"

123,Amazing quality food. With affordable set prices for both lunch and dinner. The staff are really friendly and kind. The milkshake is a must try!!
124,Solid burger and beers place!
125,Been here many times. Great burgers! Try the chocolate milkshake too - very yummy. It gets busy and takes a bit of time for the food to come buts quite well worth it.

132,Waiters are not proactive from the beginning when you are enter to this restaurant! but when it comes to sales they are pushy! You buy more beers they are happier. Otherwise you are nothing 😆
133,"Good burgers and at very good price given the nice ambience. Dinner and lunch sets are value for money. Onion rings and truffle fries were good. Burgers (number 1 & 2) were good but overall, the meal is way too salty so I took away one star for that. The saltish-ness of everything (fries, beef patty, bacon) was quite overwhelming"

144,Got there at 6pm as the place is small. My friend had a one-to-one burger voucher from Chope. Had the number 1 burger. Burgers are really  tasty--the one for one sides and beer are great too if you order before 7pm during happy hour. (Some items not applicable.) Queue formed up and was still there when I left.
145,
146,
147,Came for their lunch special. Its $12 with a small side but the size is much smaller than regular burger. If you add $3 to upsize then its becomes the regular size. A bit of a poor/con gimmick promo. The fries was quite small. Better off …

Food portion is alot. 👍 however dont recommend the milkshake. 😅 overall ok"

197,Very much enjoyed my burger (no 3)and the 10 dollar Brooklyn defender ipa (Tuesday special price). Paid 2 bucks for additional roasted red peppers on my burger. They appeared to be green and lightly fried which was disappointing.

199,For those who enjoy finger food & burgers with cold beer to whine off a hot afternoon  & evening in al fresco setting. Not my piece of cake.

221,"Good service, pretty good burgers that are little too salty, tried their Number 1 burger."
222,"Superb service and even better burgers! Came in for their $14 burger + fries lunch combo. Asian sized burger (abit small) but perfect for me, juicy and cheesy and will definitely come back again. Lettuce tomato and fresh veges are put aside. Fries are surprisingly a lot tastier than many other bars I've been to."

224,"Went thrice over the year, pretty consistent burger. Very fluffy, toasted brioche bun, thick juicy medium-rare patty. Don't need to order sides, burger alone is filling for me."

226,One of the best burger in town. Recommended.
227,Simply decorated Bistro / American steak house feel to this very small joint tucked away in a corner. Menu selection had been thankfully kept simple and limited due to obvious reasons. Food really wasn't bad. Nothing which you can fault. Nothing spectacular unfortunately.
228,Great burgers.
229,
230,Clean ambience. Burgers not spectacular but decent for the price. Drinks expensive.
231,"All American ambience... the patty is really good(medium-well done), served with soft pen seared buns. The milk shake is good but a lil pricy   compared to shake shack. Burgers are @ $14++, do take note - creating your own will be pricier..."

19,"Dear Gestro,

Which picture in particular are you referring to? please email me adam@potatohead.co
I assure you there was no trickery in the shots, just the ingredients we use in the burgers. we are a bit more expensive compared to other burger shops, because we only ever use best quality ingredients, our meats are quality grass fed from Argentina and New Zealand, only using prime cuts, all the sauces and condiments are made from scratch in house. We are not a fast food burger joint, so if you want to compare us to something like Mcdonalds, its not even in the same class, Mcdonalds makes cheap food, we make quality fresh burgers with natural ingredients, a fast food burger will be cheaper to produce than our beef patty alone.
I am happy to discuss this further,

Thank you for the feedback, was it the last order that was salty? have the previous orders been ok?
I have reiterated to the chefs to taste everything again, everything is made in. house or to our specs.
we are more pricey than some other burger shops but that is because we only use quality ingredients and everything made from scratch, our beef is only 100% prime grass fed beef, which hormone and antibiotic free, our lamb is natural fed from New Zealand and our Chicken is local fresh.
I really appreciate that you have been supporting us for the 3rd time,

81,Great atmosphere and a menu packed full of comfort food. It was difficult choosing what to order as I would have eaten just about anything on the menu. The lobster roll was a well liked by everyone in my group. I had the ribs which were mostly fat and not very good at all.
82,Had lamb shoulder & whole chargrilled lobster. Meat is well cooked but not well seasoned. So texture good but has no flavours. Shaved truffle on top but truffle itself has not much taste so it doesnt add any value to the dish at all. …
83,"Cosy place, good service and staff, interesting menu. Had the venison 200g at $40+. Steamed lobster is well cooked, $50+ for around 500g. Food is not cheap, got some discounts with Chope vouchers. So do get yours before visiting."
84,
85,Had the Wagyu beef and foie gras last night at this place. Felt nauseous the whole night. Woke up at 7am to puke. Not a fun way to begin the Christmas period. Food wasn’t cheap either. I guess it’s my bad luck to get food poisoned. I found …
86,"Hi, so sorry to hear this, we hope you are feeling better. As this is the first time we are receiving such feedback, we are currently investigating the matter. We will be reaching out to you shortly."
87,"Yummy burger, beef patty was nice, moist and very perfectly cooked. The tri-tip steak was okay. Overall, a very good experience"
88,Avoid this place if you’re vegetarian or have veggie friends. Some friends chose the place without realising there are basically no options for veggies. I asked if they could take the meat out of a portobello mushroom and replace it with …
89,The lobster thermidor is inauthentic and is more like a split lobster baked with cheese on top. The claw meat was anaemic and flimsy. The onion straws are really good.
90,"Fantastic lobster roll! Fresh lobster dressed with house made Mayo and topped with tobiko. The brioche bread was nicely toasted so it was perfect. Came with a side of greens and fries (I opted for more greens with no fries). Overall a really great lunch, will recommend it to my friends (:"
91,"Food, wine and service is great. Like the steak and mussels bisque."

For starters, the Mac & Cheese was disappointingly small (for $12). Price aside, …"
93,Excellent food.
94,Went there with a group of friends and we had a great time. The Porterhouse is a good option for sharing between 3-4 person.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff who made good recommendations on food and wine.  Definitely a great spot for grilled meats and some wines!
95,"Ordered Lobster Roll, which was excellent. However, the other 3 dishes we ordered were somewhat disappointing: the pig ears were too oily, the sauteed mushroom was mediocre, and the wagyu steak was burnt on the outside. We were expecting more for this kind of price."
96,"I have been to TMG twice with my partner, and would rate the food 5/5. However a terrible phonecall to secure a booking has screwed up the good impression I had. …"

104,Good service 👍 Food is tasty. Love the lobster roll and beef burger. Overall was a good experience!
105,"Burger beef patty tasted great, with the sauce and mushroom except that the bun was inconsistent, some are extensively burnt to the point it tasted bitter.

153,Service staff were friendly but had to wait a little before any staff gave attention. Had to call waiters a couple of times before I got their attention even though (I feel) I sat at a spot where they kept walking past. Despite the longer …
154,"This by far is the worst piece of steak I experienced. It was stated as Wagyu Grade 9 on the menu, but it did not taste anything like Wagyu at all, not to mention Grade 9!"
155,
156,5 stars service and food!
157,"Excellent food, especially the burgers. Standard beer and wine, reasonable price for HH for CBD area. Maybe a bit of a long wait due to not enough staff?"
158,Its an OK place to dine. Their steak which was their special and not listed on the menu is quite good. The blue cheese burger is not bad but no taste of blue cheese at all. …
159,
160,Second time coming here. Both times had the burger. Good food fair prices. Only issue is that for a place that calls itself a grill and does great burgers their only options for sauces for your chips are ketchup and some no name brand bottled chilli sauce. Surely a BBQ sauce would make a great addition.
161,
162,"Great burgers, but there are better ones. Service was adequate."
163,Good service and great food
164,"The burgers aren't that great, nor are the ribs. The service is a bit slow and one of the waiters always seems to be in a perpetually bad mood."
165,
166,"My mistake for not getting the lobster roll (each of the other 5 customers around us, did.) We came here for a work day lunch - I got the ribs, my friend got the fish sandwich - both underwhelming, and pretty pricey considering neither came with sides ($35 & $30 respectively.)"
167,

169,Came here on a weekday for dinner with some colleagues and there weren’t many people but it’s a cozy environment for dinner and drinks. Their menu is fairly simple but the quality is superb. Everything we ordered was good. Must order the …
170,Lobster well cooked as usual. Steak was as ordered. Brussel sprouts was bad as they were boiled before being charred. They were rather short staffed and service patchy although staff did their best and were still able to smile despite being stretched
171,"We love the Food so feedback for improvement: we really wish that the service can be improved, apparently shorthanded and disorganised on the floor, for example cutlery and wine arrived after the food came in... they are trying but it seems overwhelmed."
172,"Ordered lobster roll. Despite generous serving of lobster , food was a little underwhelming . Lobster needed to be seasoned , needed more sauce and to be cut into smaller peices. …"

180,"A late find for me but definitely a must go when in this area. Come restaurant with 2 outdoor tables, serving excellent steaks and burgers but also good mussels and lobster. The surprise find for me here were the fried pig ears (so yum!)"

194,Do not order delivery from them unless you wish to be disappointed. I ordered 2 Father’s Day set to be delivered to my godparents and to myself. Both delivery were later for 1.5hours and 2 hours respectively. The whole incident was poorly …
195,"Got takeaway, food was ok. Burgers were fantastic. But the half an hour window for delivery time is rubbish. We specified 830pm but it was as clearly made at 8pm (they were not busy) so alot of it was soggy."
196,Only tried the burgers here.. they are going at 16nett.. and man.. it's one of the better burgers out there.
197,
198,Good place to have a decent steaks after a long day of work. Like the wide range of wine selection.
199,Ordered lamb chops and burgers (signature cheese and portobello) for takeaway. Portions for the lamb chops were pathetic. Burgers were much better.
200,
201,This is medium rare. Bit of a waste as the meat was burnt and we had to cut off the black bits.

262,We had the whole lobster. It’s really fresh and tastes awesome. Steak is great too! don’t miss the cheesecake dessert!
263,
264,nice food and very tasty ! nice place! The staff very helpful .
265,
266,The seafood tower was awful. The seafood was still half frozen and the ones that weren't were very watery and tasteless. Very disappointed as we had heard such great things. The service was good but sadly that's about it.
267,This guy knows their meats
268,Great food! Great service! Loved the lobster sandwich.
269,One of the best burgers in town
270,"Excellent place for steak and seafood such as lobsters, oysters etc. Pity they squeeze in too many tables where if you come as a couple you are basically sitting next to strangers less than arm's length away and you can virtually hear everything they are saying and vice versa....."
271,
272,
273,Cold seafood platter was OK. Pork quality was great but seasoning was not to my taste.

275,
276,Loved the lobster and lobster roll but I was surprised at how good the burger was- I’ll be back for the burger next time!

294,Grilled lobster was really good
295,
296,
297,One of the oldest restaurant in this alley. Nice food and nice service. Was there for lobster roll and their signature burger. The burger is surprisingly delicious. Next time will order burger again and try the wagyu option. They also have happy hours until 7 pm.
298,
299,
300,Probably a little overrated. Wasnt blown away for the price point. Def better options else where.
301,Go for the steaks n mussels. Skip the burgers
302,
303,I used to like this place before the new menu and renovation in early 2019. Now it just seems pricey with average food and small wine pours. (BTW The Chicken Kiev in my earliest picture is from the old menu.)
304,Not as good as it used to be. Cheaper ingredients.
305,
306,"The lobster roll is lovely.. A must order.. And the lobster salad.. Food is above average.. You pay for the freshness of the food and the ambience. Its not fine dinning, more of casual dinning"
307,
308,Very nice place... £££ though if you fancy nice steak but worth the experience. Highly recommended
309,"Terrible BBQ Pork Ribs, so dry & sticked to the bone!"
310,
311,"This restaurant is a bistro style one that served crispy stuff which is a very good match to beers, such as pig ears and little silver fish. Main dishes like beef steak and pork n lamb chop are so delicious, tender and juicy. This time we ordered a famous starter, seafood tower, its prawn and lobster are so fresh and yummy."
312,"My burger patty was rare, so taking out that portion, it tasted quite good"

341,First time there... Good lobster bisque and Wagyu cheese burger
342,I think we had a little too high an expectation when we made a reservation. We had the Wagyu Tri Tip steak which didn't have the marble and fat flavouring of Wagyu and wasn't amazing. The creme brulee dessert was overly covered with sugar …
343,Seafood were really fresh and portion were great (we ordered the seafood tower)! But be prepared to leave with your clothes in smokey smell if you are seated too close to their grilling station.

369,Top quality burgers can't fault them on the food quality. Bit pricey though. 24 bucks for a cheesy is steep.
370,Very good burgers
371,The food here is amazing!!! It’s simple but done well. The bone marrow was fantastic with a well thought of marriage of flavors. The Burgers are superb!!! One of the best I’ve had. Will definitely be back!!
372,
373,
374,"We used to frequent this place often. We had a cheese burger and bleu cheese burger. Still pretty good. The fried pig ears were disappointing though, they have reduced the size of the pig ears so they don't have 'substance' when you eat them. Still worth a visit"
375,Visited on a Monday night and restaurant was barely half filled. Had the blu cheese beef burger & an overpriced $18 clam chowder soup which was very underwhelming.

423,Came here for dinner and had a great time food and service was excellent. I ordered the scallops for starters and a steak for the main course both were very good. Nice place 👍

445,
446,Bad service
447,"Food is decent. Burger is nice. Lobster roll is decent (perhaps give more fries on the lobster roll next time) hahaha. Price point is quite steep, perhaps not so value for money but it's worth a try ! Service is pretty good too. …"

450,Solid lobster
451,

464,The Portobello Burger was flavourful and the patty succulent - definitely one of the best burgers I've had !
465,
466,Their guinea rump cap was pretty good! The bernaise was pretty good choice along side. Steak could be cook more evenly instead of having char at the side.
467,
468,
469,Loved the pig crispy ears and chicken burger with salsa.
470,
471,
472,The blue cheese burger is hands down the best beef burger ive had in Singapore. Lovely atmosphere and drinks too.

475,"Nice food, a bit pricey but well worth it"
476,"Their lobbie rolls are good. Better price point than the other joints out there, while providing a very non-intrusive and enjoyable atmosphere. I just wish they'd go back to the old lobster roll seasoning because that was the bomb. 9/10"
477,Great porterhouse steak always
478,
479,
480,A very nice enviroment for lunch....Cosy and  friendly.
481,Burgers were good but a tad pricey.
482,
483,"Went there in the morning when they just open for business. We wanted to try their famous cod fish burger but only to be told they ran out of stock. Very disappointed. Ended up trying their beef burger. It was ok, have had better ones for better price."
484,
485,"Mussle served in large le Creuset, rich cream source with lobster’s head perhaps. Kept warm till the last piece. Satisfied."
486,"(Translated by Google) Two women can eat 4 cups of alcohol + 1/2 oyster + bone marrow + lobster + meat + asparagus for less than $ 250. Oysters are small and tasty and creamy. Meat appears rare, so if you usually order a medium rare, try …"
487,"Oysters were good, and steak yummy too."
488,
489,Nice food but a little pricey
490,A bit of a hidden gem that doesn't get as much attention as it should.
491,Nice trendy restaurant high end French cafeteria style. Good food and quality presented as such. A bit pricey for what you get but it's reasonable for Singapore. Overall tasty and would go back. Liked the bone marrow.
492,Friendly service!
493,The seafood was good but the pork chop was better
494,
495,"Nice cost place for lobster and grill. The fish selection is a little disappointing, only 1 grill barramundi and 1 sword fish burger."
496,"Visited The Market Grill for the first time and will definitely not be my last. The food was rather impressive and the service staff were attentive. Loved the open kitchen concept, being able to watch the chefs operate is always a delight …"
497,"Great food, excellent service. We had the whole lobster, the porterhouse and a couple dozen oysters among 3. …"
498,It was 3 of us dining and Michelle recommended we take the porterhouse steak and lobster. Excellent choice! This is a place to devour your food with your hands! We also ended up eating 2x dozen of oysters which was so creamy and delicious. Am gonna vote this a super non pretentious place with excellent quality of food and service!!
499,Great service and great food
500,Great food and great service!

503,"dated, food could be improved"
504,"Lobster roll is very very nice with very generous portion of fresh lobster meat tossed in a tangy sauce. Also tried the steak which was decent as well. Bone marrow on the other hand was lacking flavor, slightly disappointed. If i come back again, lobster roll will be my choice."
505,Was packed on a Friday evening. Well presented and great dinner. Though the Lobster Bisque was a bit weak. Attentive staff.
506,Lobster Roll was mediocre and served Cold. Service was not very attentive. Food was served fast . Quality ingredients used.

525,Fresh seafood and good burgers. Though a little stuffy and warm with the indoor grilling
526,
527,Slightly expensive but consist of a nice menu and lobster rolls too.
528,"We had the BBQ burger, chicken burger and Apple pie (tart of the day) today and everything was absolutely amazing! Even my husband loved the pie though he's not a fan of sweets."
529,Amazing surf and turf option. Also one of the best place for steaks in Singapore.

MY FAVOURITE: CW Cod Fish Burger …"
532,Very average steak for $78 there a much better restaurants out there for the same money.
533,Lobster was nicely coated with adequate sauce but does not cover up the natural sweetness of fresh lobsters. The buns are not overly greasy and has a slight hint of sweetness and charred to feast proportion.
534,
535,You will love the prok chops served here!
536,Great tasting burgers!
537,
538,"Food was tasty and larger portions (so much lobster in the lobster roll!), but service was a bit slow. Sitting on bar stools overlooking the cooks was a good show though!"
539,good lobster but a tad overpriced.
540,"I ordered the steak and lobster.
The steak is the best I've ever had. The lobster was great too.
I think the only draw back is the service could do a little better. It's not bad, just can do better."
541,"Fresh and sweet lobster roll but thought it was also slightly overpriced. Had the Wagyu chuck rib too but the utensils were severely lacking - the crab cracker were old and worn, the steak ""knife"" is blunt."
542,
543,Good place to chill
544,"Great food, very casual"
545,"Steaks are pretty good, and I enjoyed the fresh salad!"
